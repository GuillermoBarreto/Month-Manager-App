# Month-Manager-App

Month Manager is a simple personal finance app I built to better understand where my money goes every month.

The goal wasn’t to build a “perfect” budgeting tool, but something practical and easy to use: add income, track expenses, see your balance, and get a quick breakdown of spending by category.

I focused on keeping the code clean, readable, and well-structured, using TypeScript to avoid common bugs and React components to keep things modular as the app grows.
